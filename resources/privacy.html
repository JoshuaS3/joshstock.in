		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>The website available under the address https://joshstock.in is the personal portfolio and blog of Joshua Stockin (hereafter “I”). I am the owner and sysadmin of this website and therefore the data controller for any information you intentionally or unintentionally send my way.</p>
		<h2>The Information I Collect</h2>
		<p>I really don't have much on this website; just a few static pages with no client side trackers/analytics and no server side trackers/analytics besides what's built into AWS (my cloud provider, that logs bandwidth usage) and nginx (the webserver I use to host this website, that logs each HTTP/HTTPS request made to it). For each page visit, I collect, process, and log the following information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your IP Address</li>
			<li>Your User-Agent string (an identifier for your web browser)</li>
			<li>The page you request</li>
			<li>The time of request</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What I Do With Your Information</h2>
		<p>While the IP address is an identifying piece of data (and possibly the User-Agent as well), all I do with the information is process your web request so I can return pages of my website. During this process the webserver logs your information for diagnostic purposes.</p>
		<p>Your information is kept only in the webserver logs that sit on my box and my box only. I will not further use your information for any purpose nor do I have intent to do so. I have no future plans to change this.</p>
		<h2>Embedded Content from Third Parties</h2>
		<p>To make this website look pretty, I embed sources from other websites.</p>
		<h3>Embedded Sources from Google</h3>
		<p>On (almost) every page of this website, I embed the font "Fira Sans" and its derivatives from Google Fonts (Google LLC). <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">See their privacy policy here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Embedded Sources from GitHub</h3>
		<p>On some blog articles, I embed code snippets from GitHub Gist, a project of GitHub (GitHub, Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft Corporation). <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement">See their privacy policy here</a>.</p>
		<h3>Embedded Sources from Feather Icons</h3>
		<p>On the landing/home page of this website, I embed text icons from the open source Feather Icons. <a href="https://github.com/feathericons/">See their code here</a>.</p>
