This is a list of grievances regarding the CS program, in particular CS 124,
"Intro to Computer Science I", the required introductory CS course, at
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Under advisement of several software
engineering professionals, I wrote a letter concerning these grievances, sent
to:

- **Jonathan Makela** (Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, *The Grainger College of Engineering*)
- **Nancy Amato** (Department Head, *Department of Computer Science*)
- **Margaret Fleck** (Director of Undergraduate Programs, *Department of Computer Science*)
- **Eric Shaffer** (Associate Director of Undergraduate Programs, *Department of Computer Science*)
- **Geoffrey Challen** (Professor, *CS 124*)

I'm publishing this following decided inaction from the CS department and
Grainger College of Engineering regarding these valid grievances. As a student
paying exorbitant amounts of money for a high-quality education, it's my
responsibility to hold the university accountable for unfairness and
low-quality instruction out of line with their purported ideals.

<figcaption>Unfortunately, universities can often get away with shoddy quality
like this because students don't know what they don't know. How can someone
authoritatively make judgements on course and content quality without extensive
prior knowledge and experience with the subject? CS 124 has been like this for
several years now, and I'm sure if I weren't forced into CS 124 it probably
would've been several more years before anyone made a serious formal
complaint.</figcaption>

## Grievances

The following is a summary of the grievances outlined in the original letter.

### Grievance 1: Method of delivery, value of the course

CS 124, considered "traditional delivery", is entirely online and has no
lectures, discussions, or labs, and quizzes are proctored remotely over Zoom.
Stripping away in-person interaction between students deprives them of
development of real world communication and team building skills. Additionally,
the professor exposes the same course materials on the Internet for free. The
course is required of CS majors, and there is no deduction in tuition in
accordance with the low-quality online-only format.

### Grievance 2: Name-content disparity, validity as a CS course, and status as a program requirement

CS 124, "Intro to Computer Science I", is dishonestly named and advertised as a
computer science course when it is, in fact, not. It would be more aptly named
"Intro to Java Programming" (there is a difference between computer science and
computer programming). The course inadequately covers the theory, math, and
architecture of computers and computer programs, i.e. real computer science.
Students will not fully understand the ramifications of the code they write.
There is little justification for explicitly declaring it a computer science
course or requiring it of incoming CS majors.

<figcaption>Ironically,
<a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/ECE/120">ECE 120</a> and
<a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/ECE/220">220</a> are better CS
courses than "Intro to Computer Science I".</figcaption>

### Grievance 3: Choice of programming language

CS 124 is taught and tested in Java, a computer programming language
unconducive to learning computer science, and is the only course in the UIUC CS
sequence that uses Java. A student may have extensive prior programming
experience (the case for many CS majors) but may be forced to take the course
if they don't know Java—the programming language tested on the proficiency
exam—making the course little more than a hindrance to higher education.

**In essence, beginning the Computer Science main sequence with this course as
it is now is nothing but a disservice to students paying tens of thousands for
a high-quality education. CS 124 needs to transition to in-person delivery and
needs to be turned into an actual CS course that uses C or C++, akin to
[128](https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2023/fall/CS/128).  Otherwise, the
course should be redesignated as an explicit intro programming course (e.g.
"Java Programming") and made "optional but recommended" of main sequence CS
students.**

## Official Response

The very long-winded nonresponse I received from Associate Dean Makela and
Professor Challen are to the following effect for each grievance:

1. The switch to the all-online delivery method was made during the COVID
   pandemic and it was kept afterwards for CS 124 because the course
   coordinators were comfortable with it, and student performance improved by
   most metrics. There are a variety of course delivery methods utilized within
   the university and more than enough resources are provided for CS 124.
2. Teaching real computer science in CS 124 would make the course far too
   difficult for students, and real computer science is outside the scope of an
   introductory course.
3. C/C++ are too hard for CS students to learn, and Java and Kotlin are
   provided to students to offer exposure to more programming languages. If a
   student doesn't want to take the course, they should just learn Java to test
   out of the course. Also, the course instructor really likes Kotlin.

The only real action taken was the opening of booked locations on campus during
quiz times, even though the quiz is still proctored over Zoom.  Several
concerns raised in the first email remain unaddressed.  The official response
(or lack of response) to these matters is highly unsatisfactory and leads me to
question the competency and integrity of the institution.

To the official responses, I offer the following rebuttals:

1. Most other courses have returned to in-person delivery without a hitch and
   there is no reason why the CS department can't do the same.  Improvement in
   student performance is easily attributable to plagiarism, or the lack of
   academic/institutional integrity. The response does not address the concern
   regarding professional development, or quality expectations given course
   pricing.
2. Many students entering the CS program already have a good idea of how
   computers and computer programs work, or have written code prior. Holding
   back on exposing students to foundational computer systems knowledge hurts
   them in the long run as it forces them to internalize facts and methods of
   computer programming without underlying explanation—akin to having students
   try to learn calculus without prior knowledge of algebra—and forces them to
   later readjust their understandings of the subject when they are exposed to
   those fundamentals. The rationale for teaching "introductory computer
   science" in this highly abstracted manner is the result of the pervasion of
   the myth than anyone can or should learn to write code, even though software
   engineering and computer science are—and should be—highly specialized
   fields. The justification for teaching the course in the manner of a
   computer programing course is weak, and the dishonesty of calling it a
   computer science course remains unaddressed. Even as a computer programming
   course, the course is pitiful and clearly not worth what is paid in tuition.
3. A lot goes into learning a computer programming language, even if you have
   already written code and understand computer science concepts. If the course
   isn't explicitly a programming course, the expectation that a student should
   learn an entire programming language to take a proficiency exam is
   completely absurd, especially when no other course in the program requires
   it. Regardless, Java/Kotlin aren't great choices for teaching computer
   science because they are not analogs to machine code like C/C++ are; a lot
   of what the programmer writes is highly abstracted and handled behind the
   scenes, especially in the case of Kotlin.

## Closing

In an attempt to encourage action, these concerns have been forwarded to the
Higher Learning Commission, the organization that grants accreditation status
to UIUC. You can find a PDF with the email chain (which much of this article is
adapted from), in reverse chronological order, including the complaint sent to
the HLC, [here](/static/documents/uiuc-cs-complaints.pdf). It contains most of
what's detailed here, along with some extra documentation.
