<b>Hello!</b> I'm <i>Josh Stockin</i>, a student majoring in <b>Systems
Engineering</b> and minoring in <b>Computer Science</b> at <u>UIUC
Grainger</u>.  I'm a massive nerd and have spent roughly the past decade
engaging in software and embedded systems engineering hobby work, having begun
with game development and 3D animation stuffs on the Roblox platform sometime
around 2012.  When I'm not studying or working, I'll be reading or doing hobby
projects.  I try to work on hobby projects as much as I can, but I'm a
full-time student and struggle to find time.
</p>

Through prior hobby projects, I have practical and applicable experience in
programming and design for robotics and embedded systems, general user
applications, tool/utility applications, web development, and more, with
programming languages including C/C++, Python, and Lua. I've taken several CTE
courses on woodworking, AutoCAD and Fusion 360 drafting, and 3D printing.

I graduated from *Reed-Custer High School* in May 2022. At RCHS, I earned the
**Illinois State Scholar** award and became a finalist for the **National Merit
Scholarship**. I volunteered for the RCHS Recycling Club and participated in the
Math Team. On the April 2021 SAT, I earned a 790 in math and 730 in EBRW (for a
composite 1520). During high school, I took several courses at *Joliet Junior
College* part-time and for dual credit. In fall 2022 I entered my first
semester at *UIUC* with 47 transferred credit hours. I recently completed a
firmware engineering internship at **<i>Milwaukee Electric Tool</i>** for the
summer of 2023 and have accepted an offer for another in 2024.

As of 12/2023, current WIP personal projects include:

- *Embedded/Firmware*
  - The next revision of the RC snow plow (new electrical board, new motors and
    motor controllers, sensors and peripherals, rewritten firmware)
  - ePaper display (EPD) driver firmware. Lightweight graphics library, drop-in
    hardware/serial communications wrappers. Planned support for ESP-IDF
    (ESP32), Arduino
  - A handheld carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring/plotting/analytics device
    (ESP32, ePaper display, 3D printed housing)
- *Software*
  - zydeco â€” Future idea for a procedural generation world simulator. Graphics
    programming experiment.
  - resty-gitweb â€” Git version control interface for HTTP, written for
    OpenResty, uses libgit2 (live prototype at https://git.joshstock.in)
  - s3-bsync â€” Python CLI tool for file backup and bidirectional syncing
    between local filesystem and Amazon S3

I'll try over the next few months to populate the Blog and Projects pages with
information on these. Progress on each is very sporadic because I'm a full-time
student and worker.  If I'm not working on these I'm probably reading
something. I finally got a copy of K&R ðŸ˜ƒ

Oh, and I'm also a survivor of [severe scoliosis](/static/images/scoliosis.png).

Thanks for reading! You can best contact me via email at
[josh@joshstock.in](mailto:josh@joshstock.in). I usually reply within a day or
two.
