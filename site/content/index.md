<b>Hello!</b> I'm <i>Josh Stockin</i>, a 19-year-old engineering student
studying <b>Systems Engineering</b> and <b>Computer Science</b> at <u>UIUC
Grainger</u>.  I'm a massive nerd and have spent roughly the past decade
engaging in software and embedded systems engineering hobby work, having begun
with game development and 3D animation stuffs on the Roblox platform sometime
around 2012.  When I'm not studying or working, I'll be reading or doing hobby
projects.  I try to work on hobby projects as much as I can, but I'm a
full-time student and struggle to find time.
</p>

Through prior hobby projects, I have practical and applicable experience in
programming and design for [robotics and embedded
systems](https://git.joshstock.in/auto-plow), [low-level
libraries](https://git.joshstock.in/lognestmonster), [general user
applications](https://git.joshstock.in/ncurses-minesweeper), [tool/utility
applications](https://git.joshstock.in/s3-bsync),
[web](https://git.joshstock.in/joshstock.in)
[development](https://git.joshstock.in/resty-gitweb), and more, with
programming languages including C, Python, and Lua. I've taken several CTE
courses on woodworking, AutoCAD and Fusion 360 drafting, and 3D printing. At
UIUC I'm taking courses in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) and
computer science.

I graduated from *Reed-Custer High School* in May 2022. At RCHS, I earned the
**Illinois State Scholar** award and became a finalist for the **National Merit
Scholarship**. I volunteered for the RCHS Recycling Club and participated in the
Math Team. On the April 2021 SAT, I earned a 790 in math and 730 in EBRW (for a
composite 1520).  During high school, I took several courses at *Joliet Junior
College* part-time and for dual credit. I spent the summer of 2022 working at
RCHS as an Information Technology Associate, following an internship during the
schoolyear. In fall 2022 I entered my first semester at *UIUC* with 47
transferred credit hours. **I expect to graduate in 2025 with a major in *Systems
Engineering & Design* and a minor in *Computer Science*. I've accepted an
internship at *Milwaukee Tool* for the summer of 2023.**

As of 01/2023, current projects include:

- The next revision of the snow plow (new motors, overhauled electronics with
  new controllers, sensors, and peripherals, rewritten firmware)
- Website rewrite (https://joshstock.in)
- A carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring/plotting/analytics device (ESP32, ePaper
  display)
- resty-gitweb — Git version control interface for HTTP, written for OpenResty
  (live prototype at https://git.joshstock.in)
- s3-bsync — Python CLI tool for file backup and bidirectional syncing between
  local filesystem and Amazon S3

Progress on each is sporadic considering I'm a full time student. At some point
I wish to study graphics programming, procedural generation, and
geology/climate simulation. Eventually I'll populate the [projects](/projects)
page with more info about these.

Oh, and I'm also a survivor of [severe scoliosis](/static/images/scoliosis.png).

Thanks for reading! You can best contact me via email at
[josh@joshstock.in](mailto:josh@joshstock.in). I usually reply within a day or
two.
