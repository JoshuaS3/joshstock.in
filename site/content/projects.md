<figcaption>This is not a complete table, nor can I call myself an expert at
these. They're just some things I've worked with in the past.</figcaption>

**The following list is incomplete and a WIP. It will change semi-frequently as
I continue to document projects and add information, media, and kanban boards
to each project's page. Each project listing will eventually encompass use
cases, major technologies used and/or technical details, and link to the
relevant Git repositories or published blog articles.**
